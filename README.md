# Exact QnA Agent using .NET Aspire, Semantic Kernel SDK, and Azure Managed Redis

## Overview
The Exact QnA Agent returns consistency and accurate answer from the various questions customers ask. It is built using the ChatCompletionAgent using Semantic Kernel SDK and the .NET Aspire framework. Azure Managed Redis is used as a knowledge store for providing consistent answers to the questions. It's accomplished through vector similarity search with the Semantic Kernel plugin pattern.

## Run in Azure

### Deployment Steps

1. Download or fork / clone this project
1. Open a command prompt
1. Change directory to the AppHost folder
1. run ```azd up```
1. Wait for the azd process to finish
    - Error messages like "Failed to upload blob using PATCH" may be transient errors, or need VPN access.
1. Open your new deployed Azure OpenAI resource and view it in the Foundry Portal
    - Look at the "Deployments" Shared Resource. You should see a model deployment named 'embeddingModelDeployment'. This step confirms the embedding deployment model name parameter that we will configure below.
1. Change directory to *Preload-KB-Redis* folder. Set the following user-secrets to point to the resources you just provisioned:
    - Redis:SemanticCacheAzureProvider <rediss://:redis-primary-key@redis-domain-name:10000>
    - Redis:connectionString <redis-domain-name:10000,password=redis-primary-key,ssl=True,abortConnect=False>
    - AOAIResourceName <i.e. myAOAIResource, just the name, without domain>
    - AOAI:endpoint <https://resource-name.openai.azure.com/>
    - AOAI:embeddingDeploymentName <embeddingModelDeployment><i.e. the embedding deployment's name that we confirmed above>
    - AOAI:apiKey <i.e. AOAI API Key>
1. Run the *Preload-KB-Redis* project locally to load some information into Redis
1. Bring up the ChatClient service and try asking questions like:
    - What is your return policy?
    - What are your summer programs?
    - What are the rules to return products and get my money back?
    
    Observe the behavior from consistent answers to these questions. 

### Resources provisioned
- Azure Container Environment
- Two Container apps: *ChatClient* and *AgentAPI*
- Azure Managed Redis
- Azure Open AI
- GPT 4.1 model
- Ada Text Embedding model

### Clean up

run ```azd down```
